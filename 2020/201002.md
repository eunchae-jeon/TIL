## Event Emitter 사용 이유

[When should I use EventEmitter?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38881170/when-should-i-use-eventemitter)

`EventEmitter`s are meant for implementing [Publish-subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern). The idea here is that publisher - in your example it's `MusicPlayer` - doesn't know or care who subscribes to his messages. His job is simply emitting proper events and whoever listens to them will receive proper notification about the event.

Implementing publish-subscribe pattern can mitigate coupling between areas of the application.
